## Writing is not

a poem<br>
a journal article<br>
cookbooks<br>
tweets<br>
a novel<br>
a recipe<br>
a love letter<br>
...<br>

---

## Writing is

putting ideas into written words
<br>
to communicate and share them

---

## Civic tech is not

an app<br>
a website<br>
data portals<br>
a map<br>
data journalism<br>
online procurement<br>
e-voting<br>
...<br>

---

## Civic tech is

software +<br>user-centered design +<br>systems thinking +<br>iterative delivery,<br>applied to civic issues

# What's your point?
