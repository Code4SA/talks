# talks

Code4SA talks and presentations using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). Each talk is standalone in its
own directory.

You can view the talks online at http://code4sa.org/talks/[name], such as http://code4sa.org/talks/2015-05-18-indigo/.

You can also view talks just by pointing your browse to the local file, you don't need a webserver. Magic.

## Creating a new presentation

1. Copy an existing talk into a new directory following the naming format.
2. Replace the images with the new ones
3. Edit your talk's index.html
4. Add your talk to the root index.html

And you're done!
